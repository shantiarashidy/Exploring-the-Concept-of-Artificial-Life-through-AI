This paper explores the philosophical and biological aspects of "aliveness" and "consciousness" in artificial intelligence. Through a detailed analysis of the boundaries between human and machine awareness, it seeks to answer the question: Can we consider AI as truly "alive" or "aware"? This paper delves into concepts from philosophy of mind, such as the Turing Test and the Chinese Room argument, and examines ethical and philosophical questions regarding human interactions with advanced AI.
